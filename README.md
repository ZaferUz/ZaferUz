## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### Nice to meet you ðŸ˜„

- I am a development-oriented DevOps engineer with talent in human relations as well as organizational culture.

- In addition to my skills in DevOps (CI / CD, Docker, Jenkins, Ansible, Kubernetes, Grafana, Prometheus ...), Project Management (Jira, Agile Methodologies), Cloud technologies (AWS, Oracle, Azure), and computer programming languages especially Python, I have good field knowledge.

- I have always believed that there is no limit to learning. Knowledge is power and so I am pursuing this power...
